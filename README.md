## Word of the author
As a C++ game developer with a passion of always learning new things about games, game engines, new language features I found a need for a tool that would allow me to organize my projects in a more sophisticated way. By default, Visual Studio would not support such an organization very well and would force me to use filters instead of folders, or use folder organization while keeping the project / source files in the same directory which is bad for sharing the project across different platforms and also makes life more difficult when using a tool like CMake, Sharpmake, Premake... Thus the idea was born, to create this plugin that allows you to use filters as folders, create new folders, create new source files at the desired location (now you can actually split source files from VS project files!) with additional control and options. Hope you enjoy it! :)
